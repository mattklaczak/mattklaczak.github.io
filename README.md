<h3>About project 2:</h3>
I have my music, pictures and sound effects in a sub-directory titled 'resources', so just please make
sure that when viewing the webpage that /resources is in the same directory as index.html, script.js and style.css.

As far as I know, the game works as intended. The code could be neater, and if I had more time with it I would have definitely
reduced some of the verbosity of the source code. Oh well! My main goal was just to get it working for now.</p>

<h3>Basic instructions (since it varies slightly):</h3>
<p>The basic game functions the same, except there are more points per mosquito as the rounds go on and the speed also increases,
    thus making it more difficult. The biggest change are lady bugs that occasionally fly across the screen. If one is EITHER on screen
    by the time the round ends OR allowed to reach the opposite end, it counts as a survival and 300pts are given to the player. If the lady
bug is squashed, 300pts will be deducted from the player.</p>

<h3>I included a few extra features such as:</h3></ol>
    <li>Lovely, gooey sound effects when a mosquito or ladybug is squashed, or when a game over is reached</li>
    <li>Background music to celebrate my old age and nostalgia! (SNES Mario Paint, couldn't resist!)</li>
    <li>Changed the cursor to a tiny fly swatter and made sure that the point-of-contact is basically in the center of the mesh</li>
    <li>A new feature: ladybugs that randomly spawn and can either work to the benefit OR the detriment of the player!</li>
    <li>Splat effects for when the mosquitos or ladybugs are squashed! For mosquitos, there will randomly be 1 of 3 splat pics chosen,
    and for the ladybug a bright red 'X', along with a Wilhem scream! (cause I'm a movie nerd)</li>
    <li>When a mosquito escapes off screen there is a sinister laugh that can be heard! Mwahahaha</li>
    <li>As the game proceeds into further and further rounds, the speed AND points given per mosquito increases</li></ol>

<p>All the pics were gathered from google searches and the sound effects from sound effect libraries. The music from youtube.
